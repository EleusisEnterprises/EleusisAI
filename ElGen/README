# Pine Script Project: Enhanced EMA Cross Strategy

This project contains a Pine Script indicator for TradingView that enhances the EMA cross strategy with a gradient background to represent HTF trends more effectively. The project is structured to be modular and easy to manage within VS Code.

## Files

- `main.pine`: The main script where the indicator logic is defined.
- `utils.pine`: Contains utility functions to avoid redundancy in the main script.
- `constants.pine`: Stores constants, colors, and input parameters used across the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** and open the project in VS Code with the Pine Script add-on.
2. **Modify** the `constants.pine` file to adjust colors, EMA periods, or any other constants.
3. **Edit** the `main.pine` script if you want to change the core logic.
4. **Use** the `utils.pine` file to add or modify utility functions.

## Customization

- **Gradient Background**: Adjust `getGradient()` in `utils.pine` for different gradient logic.
- **Support/Resistance**: Customize `plotSupportResistance()` in `utils.pine`.
