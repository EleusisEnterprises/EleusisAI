# ElGen

**ElGen** is a specialized Pine Script-based application designed to enhance trading strategies on TradingView. It focuses on improving the traditional Exponential Moving Average (EMA) cross strategy by incorporating advanced visual and analytical features. This makes ElGen a powerful tool for traders looking to gain deeper insights into market trends and make more informed trading decisions.

## Overview

ElGen offers a modular approach to technical analysis, allowing users to customize and extend the core strategy according to their trading preferences. The current version of ElGen includes an enhanced EMA cross strategy with a gradient background that reflects higher time frame (HTF) trends, providing a clearer visual representation of market conditions.

## Features

- **Enhanced EMA Cross Strategy**: The core of ElGen is an improved EMA cross strategy that uses multiple EMAs to generate trading signals.
- **Gradient Background Visualization**: Represents higher time frame trends, helping traders quickly identify the market's overall direction.
- **Modular Design**: The codebase is structured in a modular way, making it easy to modify, extend, and manage.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can easily adjust key parameters such as EMA periods, colors, and more through a dedicated configuration file.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

To use ElGen, you will need:

- A [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) account with Pine Script support.
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Pine Script extension installed.

### Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning the EleusisAI repository and navigating to the ElGen directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EleusisEnterprises/EleusisAI.git
cd EleusisAI/ElGen
```

### Modifying the Script

1. **Open the Project**: Open the ElGen directory in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.
2. **Edit Parameters**: Modify `constants.pine` to adjust the colors, EMA periods, or any other constants as per your trading strategy.
3. **Customize the Logic**: If you wish to modify the core strategy, you can edit the `main.pine` script directly. Additionally, `utils.pine` contains utility functions that can be updated or extended.

### Using the Indicator

1. **Copy the Code**: Once youâ€™ve made your changes, copy the content of `main.pine`.
2. **Paste in TradingView**: Go to TradingView, create a new Pine Script indicator, and paste the code.
3. **Apply to Chart**: Apply the indicator to your trading chart to start using the enhanced EMA cross strategy.

## Customization Options

ElGen is designed with customization in mind. Here are some ways you can tailor it to your needs:

- **Gradient Background**: Adjust the `getGradient()` function in `utils.pine` to change the logic of the gradient background, which visualizes higher time frame trends.
- **Support/Resistance Levels**: Use or modify the `plotSupportResistance()` function in `utils.pine` to display key levels on your chart.
- **EMA Periods and Colors**: Easily change the EMA periods and color schemes by editing `constants.pine`.
